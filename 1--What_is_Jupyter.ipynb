By \"executable,\" we mean that you run the bits of code, right in the document, and get some output displayed for you. This interactive way of computing, mixed with the text, allows you to tell a story (even to yourself) with extra powers!"

Then you have the cut, copy, and paste buttons. The arrows are to move your current cell up or down. Then you have a button to \"run\" a code cell, the square icon means \"stop\" and the swirly arrow is to \"restart\" your notebook (if the computation is stuck, for example).
